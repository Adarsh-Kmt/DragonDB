# DragonDB
A key-value database, written in Go.

Check out my [substack](https://adarshkmt.substack.com/s/building-a-database), where I'll be explaining how I built it, layer by layer.

Currently working on the database server, refer to the [DatabaseServerImpl](https://github.com/Adarsh-Kmt/DragonDB/tree/DatabaseServerImpl) branch.
